"""LLM adjudication of the low-confidence tail.

The embedding pipeline does the bulk of the work cheaply and confidently; a
handful of documents sit on a cluster boundary or in a noise bucket where the
statistics are weak. This module reconsiders *only* those — selecting the
least-confident assignments, offering each its nearest candidate clusters, and
asking an LLM the one question it is good at: *does this document belong to one
of these, or is it genuinely new?* Cost scales with uncertainty, not corpus
size.

The heavy lifting stays here in the framework and is pure Python / torch:

- :func:`select_low_confidence_tail` — budgeted selection over the per-document
  confidence already on the :class:`~clustering.scenarios.base.ScenarioResult`.
- :func:`cluster_centroids` / :func:`candidate_clusters` — the ``candidates_k``
  nearest existing clusters to a document, by manifold distance to each
  cluster's centroid.
- :func:`consolidate` — assemble requests, call the injected adjudicator, and
  merge verdicts back through :meth:`Scenario.refine`.

The LLM call itself is **not** here: an :class:`Adjudicator` is injected by the
caller (dgml-core supplies a litellm-backed one), so this package keeps its
no-LLM-dependency contract.
