"""Gemini text-embedding encoder.

Embeds text with a Google Gemini embedding model through ``litellm`` — already
a dependency (used by the LLM clustering / classification paths), provider-
agnostic, so this adds no new package or license.

Single-vector text encoder. Set ``embedding_dim`` to the model's output width
(3072 for ``gemini/gemini-embedding-001``); a mismatch is caught at encode
time rather than corrupting downstream fusion silently.

Three things separate an API encoder from the local ones, and each is a knob
here rather than an assumption:

* **Credentials.** Read from ``extra.api_key``, else the env var named by
  ``extra.api_key_env`` (default ``GEMINI_API_KEY``). Finding neither is *not*
  an error: ``api_key`` stays ``None`` and litellm resolves it from its own
  environment, which is how Vertex service-account and ``GOOGLE_API_KEY``
  setups work. A genuinely absent credential surfaces as litellm's own
  authentication error on the first call.
* **Input length.** ``gemini-embedding-001`` documents a 2048-token input
  limit, and a multi-page document blows past it. What the endpoint does with
  the excess is *its* choice, not ours — in our own benchmark runs it accepted
  every over-limit request without error — which is the reason to cut the text
  ourselves: an explicit window is reproducible and bounds what we pay for,
  where an implicit one leaves both to the provider. ``cfg.max_length`` sets
  it, as a token budget converted to characters (see :data:`_CHARS_PER_TOKEN`);
  ``None`` sends the text through untouched, for callers that already
  truncated.
* **Failure.** One rate-limit response mid-corpus would otherwise discard every
  embedding already paid for in the same run, so transient failures are retried
  with exponential backoff (``extra.num_retries``, default
  :data:`_DEFAULT_NUM_RETRIES`). The retry loop lives *here*, in
  :meth:`GeminiEncoder._embed_chunk`, and not in a ``num_retries=`` kwarg:
  litellm's retry dispatch is keyed on call type and covers ``completion`` /
  ``responses`` only, so that kwarg is accepted and ignored for ``embedding``.

Select with ``encoder_text=gemini``.
