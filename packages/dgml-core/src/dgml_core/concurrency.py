"""Bounded thread-pool fan-out for independent per-page work.

Several places in this package dispatch N independent, network-bound units of
work — per-page OCR provider calls, per-page vision-style calls — and then fold
the results back together on the calling thread. :func:`map_concurrent` is the
one shape they need, so they don't each hand-roll a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.

Deliberately stdlib-only and dependency-free: :mod:`dgml_core.utils` imports
``Workspace``/``FileStore``/``DocSetStore`` and ``files`` imports ``ocr``, so
putting this there would close an ``ocr -> utils -> files -> ocr`` import cycle.
Nothing here is exported from ``dgml_core/__init__.py``; it is internal.

    """Apply ``fn`` to every element of ``items`` on a bounded thread pool.

    Returns one result per item **in ``items`` order**, regardless of the order
    in which they complete — so a caller folding results into shared state (an
    XML tree, a counter, a dict) does so deterministically, on its own thread.
    Only ``fn`` ever runs on a worker; nothing here touches caller state.

    Worker count is clamped to ``max(1, min(max_workers, len(items)))``. When
    that resolves to one — a single item, or an explicitly serial caller — the
    items run inline on the calling thread, with no pool and no thread spawned,
    so the common single-page case pays nothing and stays easy to debug.

    **Failure is fail-fast**, for callers whose ``fn`` can raise. On the first
    exception, queued-but-unstarted items are cancelled (so a dead API isn't
    hammered N more times), already in-flight items are allowed to finish and
    their results discarded, and that first exception is re-raised once the pool
    has drained. Cancellation is best-effort by construction: ``Future.cancel``
    cannot interrupt work that has already started, so up to ``max_workers``
    items may still complete. ``BaseException`` is caught rather than
    ``Exception`` so a ``KeyboardInterrupt``, or the ``CancelledError`` of a
    cancelled future, takes the same path instead of escaping the drain loop.

    **Callers wanting per-item independence make ``fn`` total** — catch inside
    ``fn`` and return a sentinel or a result object, as
    :mod:`dgml_core.style_llm` does. Nothing then ever raises out of a worker,
    no item can affect another, and every item runs. Failure isolation is a
    property of the unit of work, not of the executor; fail-fast is what you
    get only when you let exceptions escape ``fn``.
