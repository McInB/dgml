"""Contract tests for the shared bounded thread-pool fan-out.

The properties locked here are the ones both callers depend on:
input-order results (so folds stay deterministic), real parallel dispatch,
the inline serial fast path, and the fail-fast/drain semantics inherited
from the hand-rolled loop that used to live in ``ocr.py``.

There is deliberately no test for cancel-pending-on-failure: ``Future.cancel``
racing the pool picking up the next item is inherently timing-dependent, so any
"fewer than N items started" assertion would flake.
